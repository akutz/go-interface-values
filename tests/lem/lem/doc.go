// Package lem provides a comment-driven approach for writing benchmarks
// that assert when values leak, escape, and move to the heap, as well as
// the number of allocations and memory as a result.
//
// Callers may define benchmark functions with the following signature:
//
//     func(*testing.Benchmark)
//
// The functions can then be annotated with comments that are parsed by the
// lem test harness, β. These comments all begin the same way:
//
//     // lem.<ID>
//
// The <ID> is a unique ID that can be any value a developer wishes it to
// be, and the value is used for two purposes:
//
// 1. The <ID> is a key in the map β.Benchmarks and points to the actual
// benchmark function for that <ID>.
//
// 2. The <ID> is used to group all associated "lem.<ID>"" comments.
//
// There are two types of comments:
//
// 1. Those placed above the function signature
//
// 2. Those placed alongside lines inside the function
//
// The first comment occurs above the function signature and defines the
// test's name, the value used as the argument for the "name" parameter in
// the "Run" function for the types "testing.T"  and "testing.B". The
// comment takes the form "lem.<ID>.name=<NAME>".
//
// The <NAME> value is split on the "/" character in order to produce one
// to many sub-tests based on each element of the list created from the split.
//
// If the <NAME> value is prefixed with a "/" character the <ID> is not
// used as part of the value used as the arugment for the "name" parameter
// in the "Run" function.
//
// If the <NAME> value is not prefixed with a "/" character then the <ID>
// value is prepended to the <NAME>. Before being prepended to the <NAME>,
// the <ID> value may first be split into two parts of the initial value
// ends with an integer.
//
// The following are examples of valid forms of "lem.<ID>.name=<NAME>":
//
//     // lem.leak1.name=to sink
//     // lem.leak2.name=/to result
//     // lem.move.name=too large
//
// The above comments translate to the following strings:
//
//     leak/1/to sink
//     to result
//     move/too large
//
// The strings are then split on the "/" character and become:
//
// * The test case path: all elements up to the last one
// * The test case name: the last element
//
// The next comment also occurs above the function's signature and takes
// the form "lem.<ID>.alloc=<VALUE>" or "lem.<ID>.alloc=<MIN>-<MAX>".
// This comment asserts the number of allocations expected to occur during
// the execution of the benchmark. The number may be exact or an inclusive
// range. Examples include:
//
//     // lem.leak1.alloc=1
//     // lem.leak1.alloc=2-4
//
// The first example asserts a single allocation should occur while the
// second example asserts either two, three, or four allocations are
// expected to have occurred.
//
// The next comment also occurs above the function's signature and takes
// the form "lem.<ID>.bytes=<VALUE>" or "lem.<ID>.bytes=<MIN>-<MAX>".
// This comment asserts the number of bytes expected to be allocated during
// the execution of the benchmark. For more documentation please refer
// to "lem.<ID>.alloc" as both comments have the same format rules.
//
// The next comment occurs alongside a line inside of a function, and it is
// "lem.<ID>.m=<REGEX>". This comment asserts that the Go compiler's
// optimization flag "-m" should emit some type of message for the line of
// code where the comment appears, ex.
//
//     /* line 70 */ sink = x // lem.escape3.m=x escapes to heap
//
// The above code is on line 70 of a source file named escape.go, and the
// comment asserts the output from "go build -gcflags -m" should match
// the regex "escape.go:70:\d+: x escapes to heap". Please note that
// special characters must be escaped, such as "new\(int32\) escapes to heap".
//
// The last comment is a variant of the previous and takes the form
// "lem.<ID>.m!=<REGEX>". This comment asserts a provided pattern should
// not match the compiler optimization output. This is useful when you want
// to assert a variable did not escape, leak, or move. For example:
//
//     /* line 80 */ x = new(int32) // lem.escape12.m!=(escape|leak|move)
//
// The above comment asserts none of the words "escape", "leak", or "move"
// appeared in the compiler optimization output for line 80 for the source
// file in which the comment exists.
