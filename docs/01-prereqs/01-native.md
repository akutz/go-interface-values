# Native

All of the below software must be installed and configured correctly to run the examples in this repository:

* [**Go 1.18beta2+**](https://go.dev/dl/#go1.18beta2): the development version of Go
* [**delve 1.18+**](https://github.com/go-delve/delve): the Go debugger
* [**Python 3**](https://python.org): for parsing Go benchmark results

While it _is_ possible to do so successfully both on macOS and Linux, it is highly recommended to use Docker.

* For those who _really_ want to run the examples on their local system, please proceed to the [_Native_](./native/) section. 
* For those who just want to run the examples without fuss or muss, please proceed normally.

Next: [Docker](./02-docker.md)
